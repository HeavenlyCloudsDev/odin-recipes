  <h1>Pan Pizza Recipe</h1>
  <p>In my family, pizza is like water. Ask the children what they want to eat, believe me when I say they will almost always say pizza. I personally can not eat it because of the cheese. However I understand the rave.</p>
  <p>It would be very simple to pop a Digernos into the oven so I am going to complicate things today and give a recipe I just thought of in my head. Enjoy</p>


  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>Pillsbury Classic Pizza Crust</li>
   <li>Rao's Homemade Pizza Sauce</li>
   <li>Hormel Pepperoni Original</li>
   <li>Mozzarella Cheese, Shredded</li>
   <li>Riccota cheese</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Steps</h2>

   <li>Preheat the oven on 425 &deg; F</li>
   <li>Grease the cast iron pan with oil.</li>
   <li>Unroll the dough on to a sheet and press it to how thick you would like it.</li>
   <li>Add the Rao's Homemade Pizza Sauce.</li>
   <li>Then, add cheeses.</li>
   <li>After you add the cheese place the pepperonis on top.</li>
   <li>Transfer the pizza from the sheet to the oiled cast iron.</li>
