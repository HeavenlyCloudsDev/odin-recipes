# odin-recipes
Trying to get this right but I had to start over completely.
Had to redo. The commit finally worked but I still dont see it so lets seen if we have trouble again. 

Added a recipe page opened a new folder in odin-recipes for images and placed content on the recipe webpage. I already did this and had to redo it again.

So I know this lesson seems a little confusing. I am simply going to copy and paste the code I have already written and paste it into two more pages. This is because I was having issues with committing to my remote repo and now I am able. I also knew nothing was wrong with my code so I did copy and paste it into doc file. 

forgot to add the links into a list :D
