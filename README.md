# odin-recipes
Trying to get this right but I had to start over completely.
Had to redo. The commit finally worked but I still dont see it so lets seen if we have trouble again. 

Added a recipe page opened a new folder in odin-recipes for images and placed content on the recipe webpage. I already did this and had to redo it again
